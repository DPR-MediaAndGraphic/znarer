ZNARER. What is it?
======
Znarer is a full responsible, lightweight, easy costumizable and free wordpress theme. You have 2 menu hooks: principal menu and secondary menu) and 2 widgets hooks: sidebar and footer.

INSTALATION
======
Like any other wordpress themplate you only have to copy/move the theme’s folder to: wp-content/themes/ In your server or local host. Then you just have to go to your Dashboard > Appearance > Themes and select the theme you’ve downloaded.

Note: some themes work fine with some plugins, and we, many times, include those plugins on the .rar file, so maybe you can find two folders on it: one called plugins and the other called themes. You’ll have to copy the content of the plugin’s folder to: wp-content/plugins/

And the content of the theme’s folder to: wp-content/themes/
Remember to activate the plugins on Dashboard > Plugins menu.

FEATURES
======

For me it’s really important that you, or your client, can customize mostly everything on your new template so I’ve used the Dashboard > Appearence > Costumize menu to let you modify all the colors of your blog or website.

SHORTCUTS
======

To check the diferents shortcuts aviable on Wordpress blog theme you should visit the  feature’s seccion of the demo version.

COLUMNS
As you can see you are able to make diferents columns with an easy shortcut like this:

[two_column]    Text you want    [/two_column]

[three_column]    Text you want    [/three_column]

[four_column]    Text you want    [/four_column]

In order to make things a little bit easier, you only have to put the whole text between the two shortcut’s code referenced with orange color in the previous example. Automatically text/images will be displayed as a two, three of four column text/grid.

SECTION
If you want to make some order on your website’s content you can use the section shortcut. It will display as a full width line that makes a separation between contents. In fact it’s just a 1 px line with the header background color but you can also add to it an html color. Let’s see an example:

[section]     This will display a 1 px line with the header background color
[section color=”#333”]      This will display a 1 px line with grey color

ICONS
Znarer comes with a 200 icons set aviable. You can add icons to your posts, pages or widgets just typing a simple shortcut. Let’s see an example:

[icon type=”facebook29” width=”24”]

This example will display a 24x24 px Facebook icon on your post, page, widget... As you can see it’s really easy to use all the icons you need to for your website or blog. 

Need more icons? No problem! You only have to copy your own icons to the icon’s theme folder and put them into the 16, 24 or 48 folder (depending of the image width you’ll put it on a folder or on another). So you’ll be able to use as many icons as you want to.

Note: For this shorcut you need to have the “icon” folder placed in the them directory. Also it’s important to use 16, 24 or 48 folders because the shortcut is looking for the icons on this folders . If you want to create a personal folder for your icons remember to use the width attribute as your folder’s name, for example:

[icon type=”facebook29” width=”personal_folder”]
